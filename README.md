# About

This project, written using React library, is about simulating 'smart' devices by mocking a web socket connection with fake data that's randomly generated. For now there are only 3 types of devices (support for more can be easily added by providing appropriate class definitions in DeviceInterfaces.tsx as well as a case statement in the returnDeviceObject factory). By clicking on a device card, a more detailed one will pop up, which can be freely moved around the site and resized.
